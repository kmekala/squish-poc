# Squish UI & API Automation POC

This project demonstrates how to use **Squish** for UI automation combined with API automation in a single test suite. The project is containerized using Docker and Docker Compose, making it easier to set up and run the tests in a consistent environment.

# Key Components
 Dockerfile: Defines the environment for running the Squish tests, including dependencies for Squish and Python.
 docker-compose.yml: Orchestrates the Docker environment for the project, ensuring the services run together.
 requirements.txt: Lists the Python dependencies (e.g., requests) required for API testing.
 squishrunner.conf: Configuration file for SquishRunner, which handles how tests are executed.
 testsuite/: Contains the Squish test suite and related test scripts.
 test_login.py: The main test script that combines UI interactions and API validation.
 page_objects/: Contains page object models for UI testing.
 api_client/: API client and service layer for sending API requests and validating responses.
 utils/: Utility scripts, such as logging.
 reports/: Directory to store test execution reports generated by Squish.

# Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:

Docker: Install Docker
Docker Compose: Install Docker Compose
Ensure you have access to Squish by downloading it from froglogic's official website or by using your organization's Squish license.

# Setup Instructions
## 1. Clone the Repository
Clone this project to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/squish_ui_api_automation.git
```

cd squish_ui_api_automation

## 2. Download and Place Squish in the Project
Download the appropriate Squish version (e.g., squish-6.7.1-linux64.zip) from the Squish Download Page and place it in the project folder.

Alternatively, if the Dockerfile is configured to download Squish directly, you can skip this step.

## 3. Build the Docker Environment
Build the Docker image for the project using Docker Compose:

```
docker-compose build
```

### This will:

Install all required dependencies.
Set up the Squish environment.
Install any Python dependencies listed in requirements.txt.

## 4. Run the Tests
To execute the Squish tests, use Docker Compose:

```
docker-compose up
```

### This command will:

Launch the Docker container.
Run the Squish tests defined in the testsuite/ folder.
Output test results to the reports/ folder.
## 5. Access Test Reports
After the tests have executed, you can find the results in the reports/ directory. The reports may include logs, screenshots, and detailed results of the test run.

# Test Suite Overview
## UI Automation
UI interactions are handled using Squish and are defined in the testsuite/shared/page_objects/ directory.

Page Object Model: The login_page.py script represents the login UI page and defines methods to interact with the UI elements (e.g., entering credentials, clicking buttons).

## API Automation
API requests and validations are handled using Python and the requests library. The API client is structured in the testsuite/shared/api_client/ folder.

API Service Layer: The api_service.py script contains methods to send API requests (e.g., POST, GET) and validate their responses.

## Example Test Case: test_login.py
The test_login.py script demonstrates how UI and API automation are combined. Here’s a high-level overview of what it does:

## UI Automation: Automates the login process by interacting with the login page.
## API Validation: After a successful login, it sends an API request to validate the user's session or retrieve user data.
